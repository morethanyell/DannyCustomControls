# My Wish as a Originator
I'd like to call myself as the originator, instead of the author because my wish is for this project to
be a community project. I hope that

    1. Cs / IT students learn to use versioning or Git, especially this site GitHub
    2. This will broaden, meaning more suggestions and improvements are added by contributors
    3. People learn how to create your own controls, instead of using Bunifu
    4. Just enjoy coding
